Mark Little NavMap airports as addon if they exist in MSFS Addons Linker 2024 database

Little NavMap is not able to mark the airport as an addon because the procedure of building the database of MSFS 2024 changed.

Therefore there is no indication in LNM if an airport is an addon or not.

I am usign this feature a lot since i need to plan my next flight between airports that are addons and not default and also i need LNM for all other planning tasks.

The solution i found is to read the database of MSFS Addons Linker 2024, get the addon airports that i have and flag them in the LNM database.

It is a quick and dirty python script, and i also provide the compiled .exe file as a release.
